            We'll be greeting family and friends on Sunday morning at the City
            Reliquary, a beloved museum of local history and ephemera in
            Williamsburg, Brooklyn. We'll have the museum to ourselves until 12
            pm, and will continue to have private access to the museum's backard
            until 2. Since we'll mostly be outdoors, be sure to dress for the
            weather! We'll have light bites, drinks, and coffee to share as well
            as Hot Tips for our favorite things to check out in Williamsburg and
            Greenpoint.
